### About This Chapter

The chapter  examines operating systems from three different perspectives:

- through the set of .greenbold[services] that it provides to .greenbold[users and programmers];

- through the set of .greenbold[interfaces] that it makes available to .greenbold[programmers];

- through its .greenbold[design and implementation], of interest to those study and
design operating systems.

It covers the following topics:

- Operating system services
- User interfaces
- System calls
- System programs
- Operating system design and implementation structures
- System boot

### Chapter Objectives


You should be able to

- identify the services provided by an operating system and whether they are directed
at users, programmers, or both;

- explain in detail how system calls are used to provide operating system services
to programs;

- explain how operating systems and system software support program development and
execution, from  source code to executable image;

- compare and contrast the different structural designs of operating systems, such as
monolithic, layered, microkernel, modular, and hybrid; and

- explain the process of booting an operating system.

### Services Provided by the System

Recall from Chapter 1 that the operating system's services can be categorized, for the
most part, as being in one of the following groups:

- .greenbold[Program execution]
- .greenbold[I/O operations]
- .greenbold[File systems]
- .greenbold[Communication]
- .greenbold[Error detection and recovery]
- .greenbold[Protection and  security]
- .greenbold[Accounting]

as illustrated below.

name: user-interfaces
### User Interfaces

For a user to access any of these services, some type of user interface to the
operating system is required. It can be any of:

- .greenbold[Command-Line Interface] (.greenbold[CLI])
- .greenbold[Graphical User Interface] (.greenbold[GUI])
- .greenbold[Touch Screen]

These will be explained shortly.

Regardless of which interface is used, users can access all types of services,
although some may be more useful to users than others.

### Services For Users

- .greenbold[Program execution]: The operating system gives users the ability
to run applications and programs. This is an important category of service.

- .greenbold[I/O operations]: The applications and programs run by users require input and produce
output. The operating system provides the environment in which this can happen.

- .greenbold[File systems]: Users and their software can create and delete files and directories,
read and modify them, rename them, search through them, list properties of them,
and share and protect them. The operating system provides support for all of this.

- .greenbold[Protection and security]: Users need control of who can access their data. The
operating system provides security and protection for both files and executing
programs.

--

Indirectly, users require services such as .greenbold[error detection and recovery] when their
files get corrupted, or their programs "crash", or worse, when the system itself
enters some error state.

--

They also require that the system perform .greenbold[accounting] so that they can monitor things
such as disk usage, memory usage, networking traffic and so on.

--

Lastly, sometimes users explicitly request that the system .greenbold[manage resources], such as by requesting
that certain programs run with lower priority, or by requesting that certain file
systems be mounted in restricted modes.

### Schematic View of Services

Users obtain services either directly through a user interface such as
by typing a command in a command-line interpreter, or indirectly, by running
an application that issues a request.  In the first case, the command is executed by a
.greenbold[system program]. In the second case, it might be either a system program
or a .greenbold[system call] that provides the service.

name: cli
### Command-Line Interfaces

A .bluebold[command-line interface], (.bluebold[CLI]) is a type of user interface in which
a user enters a command by entering plain text followed by a .redbold[newline] character.

- Usually, there is a .redbold[prompt] of some kind to indicate that the user is supposed to enter the command.
- The text must conform to the syntax expected by the interface.
- When the newline is entered, the interface tries to run the command.

--

People use the term .greenbold[command-line interpreter] interchangeably although
there is a difference:

- .redbold[A command-line interpreter is a command line interface, but not vice versa].
A command line interface is more general - application programs such as MatLab or
GNU Octave have command line interfaces, but they are not command line interpreters.

--

In the UNIX world, a command line interpreter is called a .bluebold[shell].
The shell is not just a command line interpreter in UNIX,
but a .redbold[full-fledged programming language].
Examples of shells are
- the .greenbold[.fixed[Bourne-again Shell]] (.fixed[bash]),
- the .greenbold[.fixed[C Shell]] (.fixed[csh]), and
- the original .greenbold[.fixed[Bourne shell]] (.fixed[sh]).

### Command-Line Interpreters and Terminals

To use a CLI, the user must open a .greenbold[terminal] or a .greenbold[pseudo-terminal] window.super[1].
.footnote[
1 You can also use a remote login program such as `ssh` to remotely login to a system, in which case you are automatically
given a shell session. ]

Apple systems also have a .greenbold[Terminal] application, and Windows
has both the .greenbold[Powershell] and
the old standby, `command.exe`, in which you can run DOS commands.
