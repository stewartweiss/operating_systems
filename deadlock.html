## Resource Classes

- Resources can be either .greenbold[shareable] or .greenbold[non-shareable].
Resources are shareable if they can be held simultaneously by
different processes.
  - Examples: read-only files, shared read-only memory

- Shareable resources are not involved in deadlock so we do not
consider them any further.

- Non-shareable resources are held in mutual exclusion by a process.

- Non-shareable resources can be either .greenbold[consumable] or
.greenbold[serially reusable].
  - Examples of consumable resources: messages, signals, interrupts, jobs to be
completed.
  - Examples of reusable resources: printers, disk blocks, memory pages,
device locks

- We focus on reusable resources in this chapter.

name: system_model
## System Model

- We assume
  - a finite number __n__ of processes, P.sub[1], P.sub[2],...,P.sub[n]
  - a finite number __m__ of resource types, R.sub[1], R.sub[2],...,R.sub[m]
such that each type R.sub[k] has W.sub[k] identical instances.

    Examples of resource types are memory blocks, disk blocks, etc.
--

- To use a resource, a process must:
  1.  .redbold[request] the number of units of that resource that it wants, but less than
  the total number of units existing in the system (i.e., W.sub[k] units of R.sub[k]),
  and if not all units are available, __it enters a wait state__;
  1.  .redbold[acquire and use] the resource units; and
  1.  .redbold[release] all units of that resource that it has acquired.

--

- Steps 1 and 3 above are system calls usually, The operating system must validate
and service them. Bad decisions about granting requests can result in
.greenbold[deadlock].

name: prevention
## Deadlock Prevention

- In order to prevent deadlock we must remove one of the necessary
conditions. Consider each in turn:

  - Mutual Exclusion:
